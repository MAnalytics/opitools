Title: A Tool for Analyzing Opinions in a Text Document
Version: 1.0.3
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut],

Description: This tool is designed for analyzing the opinions 
  inherent in a digital text document (TDT). Given a text document, this 
  package allows a user to assess the extent to which a theme
  or subject within the document impacts the overall opinion 
  expressed by the document. The package can be applied to a wide 
  variety of opinion-based DTD, including commentaries on social media
  platforms (Facebook, Twitter etc.), Product websites (e.g. review 
  sections) and so on. The utility of the `Opitools` has been demonstrated 
  in Adepeju and Jimoh (2021) <doi:10.31235/osf.io/c32qh> in the 
  assessment of impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on neighbourhood policing.
