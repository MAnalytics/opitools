Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut],

Description: This tool is designed for analyzing the opinions 
  inherent in a digital text document. Given a text document, this 
  package allows a user to assess to what extent an identified theme
  or subject within the document has impacted the overall opinion 
  expressed by the document. This package can be applied to a wide 
  variety of digital text documents, including electronic articles,
  social media text contents, etc. The utility of the `Opitools` 
  has been demonstrated in Adepeju and Jimoh (2021) 
  <doi:10.31235/osf.io/c32qh> in the assessment of impacts of COVID-19 
  pandemic on public opinions concerning neighborhood policing across 
  England and Wales.
