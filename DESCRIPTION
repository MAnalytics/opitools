Title: A Tool for Analyzing the Opinions in a Text Document
Version: 1.5.0
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut],
Maintainer: Monsuru Adepeju <monsuur2010@yahoo.com>
Description: This tool is designed for performing opinion impact analysis 
  of a digital text document (DTD). Given a DTD, this 
  package allows a user to assess the extent to which a theme
  or subject within a document impacts the overall opinion 
  expressed in the document. The package can be applied to a wide 
  range of opinion-based DTD, including commentaries on social media
  platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube), online products 
  reviews, and so on. The utility of `Opitools` was originally demonstrated 
  in Adepeju and Jimoh (2021) <doi:10.31235/osf.io/c32qh> in the 
  assessment of COVID-19 impacts on neighbourhood policing using 
  Twitter data. Further examples can be found in the vignette of 
  the package.
