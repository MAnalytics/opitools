# Statement of Need

The recent proliferation of digital textual documents (DTD), across a wide range of application domains, has not only heralded enormous data opportunities, but also new advances in the opinion mining of natural language texts [@Liu:2012; @Tsapa:2019]. However, in spite of the availability of wide variety of opinion mining tools [@Tai:2015; @Kiomourtzis:2014; @Wawer:2016; @Munson:2019], there has been a lack of capability for assessing how inherent themes or subjects within a digital text document (DTD) may have impacted the overall opinion expressed by the document. The `opitools` package is designed in R language to address the aforementioned problem. That is, given a text document the package allows a user to assess the extent to which a theme or a subject referenced within the document impacts the overall estimated opinion. The package can be applied to any opinion-based DTD, such as commentaries from social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and reviews on product or service websites. We demonstrate the application of `opitools` in social research with an example from law enforcement domain [@Adepeju:2021]. The utility of `opitools` for wider social research application is demonstrated with with examples from political, entertainment and marketing domains (see the documentation of `opitools::opi_impact` function). With these demonstrations, the package show the capability to identify the most important issues that may be driving the opinions expressed by individuals on a given subject matter.


# Implementation

Given a text document comprising individual record texts, the goal is to computationally classify the sentiments expressed in each text record into positive, negative or a neutral sentiment, using a lexicon-based classification approach [@Nielsen:2011; @Adepeju:2021]. The resulting sentiment scores across records are combined in order to derive the overall opinion score of the text document. Then, to assess the impacts of an inherent theme (or subject), within the document, on the estimated opinion score, we simply ask the question, *If expected opinion scores were generated under the null hypothesis, how likely would we be to find a score higher than the estimated score?*. In order to answer the question, we employed a non-parametric randomization testing strategy [@Fisher:1935; @Good:2006], which involves generating an expectation distribution of the observed score through random re-assignment of sentiment labels of the original text records. The re-assignment is repeated a large number of times to obtain an expectation distribution. Lastly, the observed score is compared with the expectations in order to derive the statistical significance of the impacts.


# Key Functionalities

The key function of `opitools` package is the `opi_impact()`. The `opi_impact()` function draws from two other supporting functions, `opi_score()` and `opi_sim()`, to compute the observed score and its expectations, respectively. The function presents a range of opinion score functions and a `'fun'` parameter in order to allow integration of a user-defined score function. The latter provision is to encourage the uptake of `opitools` package in a wide variety of application domains.
