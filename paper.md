# Statement of Need

Since the year 2000, various computational intelligence techniques have been developed for analyzing sentiments of users either in the field of natural language processing or computational linguistics. To date, the majority of the techniques as deployed across various fields, such as Social research [@Somasundaran:2010; @Morency:2011; @Nikolovska:2020], Market research [@Feldman:2011; @Otaibi:2018], and in Electoral politics [@Ansari:2020; @Connor:2010] have focused largely on detecting subjectivity, and/or extracting and classifying sentiments and opinions in a text document. Building on this existing work, the current paper advances an opinion impact analytical tool, namely; `Opitools`, that does not only extracts inherent themes from within a digital text document (DTD), but also evaluates the extent to which a specified theme may have contributed to the overall opinion expressed in the document. Given the stated advancement, `Opitools` holds prospect for wider applications as compared to the existing techniques in the aforementioned application fields. For example, in Law enforcement, the package can be deployed to understand factors that drive public perception of the police service [@Adepeju:2021]; in Market research, to identify factors that underlie customers satisfaction in a product; and, in Electoral politics, to identify factors that may be influencing electoral opinions in an upcoming election. These examples are also demonstrated in documentation of the package (please see the `README.md` and the package `Vignette` for details). Lastly, it is argued that this contribution provides a framework by which some of the existing opinion mining tools [@Tai:2015; @Kiomourtzis:2014; @Wawer:2016; @Munson:2019] may be further advanced for wider research impacts.

# Implementation

For a text document comprising individual text records, the goal is to computationally classify the sentiments expressed in each text record into positive, negative or a neutral sentiment, using a lexicon-based classification approach [@Nielsen:2011; @Adepeju:2021]. The resulting sentiment scores are combined in order to estimate the overall opinion score of the document. To assess the impacts of a selected theme (or a subject) on the estimated opinion score, we simply ask the question; *If expected opinion scores were generated under the null hypothesis, how likely would we be to find a score higher than the estimated score?*. The question is answered by employing a non-parametric randomization testing [@Fisher:1935; @Good:2006] strategy involving random re-assignment of sentiment labels of the original text document to derive the expectation distribution. By comparing the observed score with the expectation distribution, the statistical significance of impacts is derived.


# Key Functionalities

The key function of `Opitools` is the `opi_impact()` which draws from two supporting functions, `opi_score()` and `opi_sim()`, to compute the observed opinion score and its expectations, respectively. Four different opinion score functions are embedded in the package, plus a `'fun'` parameter to allow a pre-defined user score function. Other functions, `word_distrib` and `word_imp` are provided for a prior exploratory analysis of a text document.
