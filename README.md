# "opitools"

An R-package for analyzing Opinions in Big Digital Text Document (DTD)

## Description

The `opitools` is an R package for exploring a digital text document (DTD) as well as performing the impact analysis of the opinions expressed by the DTD. The package is particularly suited for opinion-based DTD, such as individual-level posts (e.g. commentaries on Twitter or Facebook) and comments (as in an online product reviews). First, an `exploratory` function `word_imp` can be used to identify words relating to different themes (or subjects) that are referenced in a DTD. The `opi_impact` function can then be utilized to investigate whether an identified/specified theme (or subject) impacts the overall opinion expressed by the document. The potentials of `opitools` for application across a wide range of domains is described briefly here (see the `vignette` for details). 

## Installation from `CRAN`

From an R console, type:

```{r}
#install.packages("opitools")
library(opitools)

```

To install the developmental version of the package, type:
`remotes::install_github("MAnalytics/opitools")`. Please, report any
installation problems in the issues.

## Example usage

Below is an example usage of how `opitools` can be employed to identify themes (or subjects) from a DTD and then deployed to perform opinion impact analysis. 


### Importing the dataset

The `policing_dtd` - a DTD comprising Twitter posts about police/policing in a neighbourhood, will be used in this demonstration.

```r
> data(policing_dtd)

```

### Identify themes (subjects)

Utilize `word_imp` function to highlights terms or words in accordance to their importance in the DTD. Through visual inspection, collate related terms or words that denote specific theme or subject from the generated wordcloud. Several words relating to the COVId-19 pandemic, including 'infect', 'pandemic', and 'lockdown' can be identified as been important in the document. These words are provided as `covid_theme` in the package. The function can be ran as follows (see the documentation for details): 

```r
> p1a <- word_imp(textdoc = policing_dtd, metric= "tf", 
                           words_to_filter=c("police","policing"))
```

### Impact analysis

The impact analysis can be conducted as follows:

```r
#Running the analysis

results <- opi_impact(textdoc = policing_dtd, theme_keys=covid_theme, metric = 1,
                       fun = NULL, nsim = 99, alternative="two.sided",
                       pplot = TRUE, quiet=FALSE)
                       
print(results)

$test
[1] "Test of significance (Randomization testing)"

$criterion
[1] "two.sided"

$exp_summary
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 -8.240  -5.880  -5.880  -5.028  -3.530  -1.180 

$p_table


|observed_score |S_beat |nsim |pvalue    |signif |
|:--------------|:------|:----|:----|:------|
|-5.88          |56     |99   |0.52 |'      |

$p_key
[1] "0.99'"   "0.05*"   "0.025**" "0.01***"

$p_formula
[1] "(S_beat + 1)/(nsim + 1)"

#......

```

The output above shows the assessment of pandemic impacts on public opinion on neighbourhood policing. The output shows an overall negative opinion (`-5.88`) of the public on the neighbourhood policing, and that the pandemic has not had a significant impacts (`pvalue` = 0.52) on the opinion expressed by the public. The research question in the above example can be stated as thus: "what is the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the citizens' opinion of their neighbourhood policing" (see details in a similar study that utilized `Opitools`, [adepeju, M. and Jimoh, F. (2021)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c32qh/)). 

### Other applications

Table 1 summarizes the analysis using the remaining two example datasets provided in the package. The outputs from the law enforcement application (as in above) is entered in the first row of the table. 

```r

| Column 1       | Column 2     | Column 3     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  Cell Contents | More Stuff   | And Again    |
| You Can Also   | Put Pipes In | Like this \| |

```

In each example, the same opinion score function is employed (`metric = 1`, i.e. `polarity score = (P - N)/(P + N)*100`), where `P` and `N` represent `positive` and `negative` sentiments, respectively. See the documentation for details. Employing a threshold of `p=0.05`, any p-value less or equal to the threshold (e.g. example 2a) represent a significant impact of the specified theme on the overall opinion score.
